Experimental setup
Treatments:  
Naive - healthy mice  
Negative Control - mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce gut inflammation that leads to weight loss. These mice do not receive any treatment.  
Pontikilin, Choir√≠din and Tipotium - treatments to prevent the effect of LPS. The treatments are administered to mice previously treated with LPS.  

Diet:  
Grass - normal diet  
Grass and Carrot - normal diet plus carrots  

Mice:
All 60 mice are female, same age and genotype. If they were not treated, they would all be expected to be similar to the Naive group, weighting around 20g at the time of measurements.
